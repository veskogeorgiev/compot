*. Fetch to use iterable instead of list
*. cerate .size() method in query
*. getReadableCompot() and getWritableCompot() ???
*. implement clone on SelectStatment and cache it in DAOImpl
*. implement delete() like query(), so that you don't have to first fetch an object and then delete it	 
*. add support for more SQL type
*. probably combine Compot and CompotFactory in on object
